# Mandelbrot Set Visualization
Visualizing Mandelbrot in python using Matplotlib.pyplot and numpy


Mandelbrot set is a really amazing mathematical fractal, it just iterates a quadratic equation on a complex plane. It's
formula is: zn+1 = zn2 + c (n+1 is subscript of z and so is n^2 for the second z, and "c" is a complex number).

this is what your output will look like.

*Pre-requisites* for this project is that you should have numpy and matplotlib.pyplot downloaded in your system which if not, you can easily download by going to cmd and using the 'pip install' command.
